# CryptoClustering

This contains the complete assingment for unsupervised learning. The following questions were answered:

### Question: 
What’s the best value for k? Answer: 4

### Question: 
What’s the best value for k when using the PCA data? Does it differ from the best value for k that you found by using the original data? Answer: Best PCA k value is 3, which differs from using the original data.

### Question:
Based on visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what’s the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means. Answer: The graph with fewer features is easier to interpret because there is a clearer relationship between the clusters. However, the quality of the clusters is put into question due to loss of information.
